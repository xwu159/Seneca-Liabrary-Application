1.For workshop 3 part 1 Lab part
(1)void Item::setEmpty() {
        m_price = 0.0;
        m_itemName[0]= '\0';
    };
I put null in single quote at first, it is treated as character. in C++, 'null' is not a valid character. \0 in C++ has a value of zero.
(2)    void Bill::display()const {
        Title();
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < m_itemsAdded; i++) {
            m_items[i].display();
        }
        footer();
    };
for the for loop, I need to increment i until m_noOfItems instead of m_itemsAdded.
(3)I learned how to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory. When ever open file or allocate memory, we need destructor to prevent the memory leak.
