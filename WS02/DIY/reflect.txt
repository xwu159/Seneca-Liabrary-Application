1. For workshop2 Lab Part, (1)I learned about the memory allocation and deallocation. Any memory allocated with "new" must be deallocated with "delete", otherwise, it will cause the memory leaks and crash the program.(2) When function implement, I need to make sure the syntax and logic are both correct, even the compiler didn't report any error, it doesn't mean it is correct, how to make a fool proof program, it need a lot of experiences and we need to use different types of data to do the test to improve the code.
2. For workshop2 DIY Part, the logic is almost the same. When the implement of Population.cpp module, I create a variable called noOfRecords, but it has name refliction which cause the bugs,noOfRecords is a function, it should be an integer variable at the same time. I rename it to numRecords and set it to the return value of noOfRecords, finally it go through. For the read function, I forgot to change read postalCode to read until "," which can not read succefully at the first beginning, and it is better to format the postalCode to %3[^,], then it specifies the maximum field width to be read by fscanf function.
